**What did you do this past week?**  
This past week, we started connecting our website to our database, as well as filling our database with data from the APIs we found in phase 1.

**What's in your way?**  
We will need to rewrite our tables with react to load one page of data at a time. Loading everything at once returns too much data and makes our site too slow.

**What will you do next week?**  
Phase 2 is due on Thursday. We should finish that soon and not have to deal with last minute fixes like in phase 1. If we finish early we can make sure that everything is complete and still have time left over to fix anything that needs fixing.

# The Class
We only had one real day of class this week, where we talked about regex. On Wednesday, Pariveda gave a talk about how they've taken concepts from software engineering and are using them in real work. Friday was UTCS's 50th anniversary, and class was cancelled. The day was filled with talks we could go to instead of class.  

# Tip of the Week  
Digital Ocean and GitHub had an event called Hacktoberfest going on this past month. If you made four commits to any open source repos during the past month you could get a free shirt. This encouraged looking for neat projects on GitHub and finding small ways you could contribute and help out other people.
