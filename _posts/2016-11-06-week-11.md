**What did you do this past week?**  
This past week, we finished up phase 2 of the IDB project. We started this project early, so we ended up finishing before the deadline on Thursday.  


**What's in your way?**  
The iOS beta version is due this upcoming week, so I will need to spend time with my iOS group finishing up what we've planned for this phase, on top of the IDB project and trying to understand what we're covering in network security.  


**What will you do next week?**  
Next week I will work on iOS and we will get started on the final phase of the IDB project, where we will have to add a search functionality and visualize another group's data. We will also need to start preparing a presentation about our project.

# The Class
This past week of class had us learning about ways to store data like XML, JSON, and SQL. We covered these topics in the data management class, so it wasn't too unfamiliar. I do need to review some SQL because it's been a while since I did any work with it, and subqueries can get confusing.  


# Tip of the Week  
Get started on the projects early. This will give you time to fix anything you didn't get done during the previous phase, and leave you time at the end to make sure you have everything done and fix any bugs you might have missed. It's much less stressful when you can finish early.
