**What did you do this past week?**  
This past week, I have started and almost finished the Netflix project, and started to prep for the career fair.

**What's in your way?**  
This week is career fair, so that and related events will take up a large chunk of time. I'll have to make sure to make time to do all my homework and projects.

**What will you do next week?**  
Next week is career fair, followed by even more company events and interviews. I have to finish up a few projects, like Netflix for this class, as well as our first Network Security project and some iOS homework.
