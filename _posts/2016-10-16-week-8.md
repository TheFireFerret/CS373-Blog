**What did you do this past week?**  
This past week, I found a group for project 3 and spent a long time trying to come up with a good idea. Then we worked on getting our github, AWS, and various services set up.  

**What's in your way?**  
Since the project teams are 6 people, it will be hard to schedule times where everyone can meet up. We will have to figure out how we can all work on the project even when we are apart.

**What will you do next week?**  
Next week we will finish up phase 1 of this project, as well as getting started on our app for iOS mobile computing.

# The Class
Decorators in Python seem to be a lot easier to use than in other languages, like Java. In Python you can just add a '@<func>' in front of a function to change the function into a decorated function. Python automatically calls the function in the decorator tag and puts that result into the name of the function that is being decorated.  
I'm excited to learn a lot more about web development from this big project, since the most I've done before has mostly been contained to hackathons, where our sites were just staticly hosted on github pages and had very little for a backend.


# Tip of the Week  
Always review the previous class notes before the next one. If we build off of things we did the last class, it will be very helpful for you to fully understand what happened last time.
