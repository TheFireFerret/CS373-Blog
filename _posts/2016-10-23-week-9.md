**What did you do this past week?**  
This past week, we finished up phase one of the IDB project. I also spent the weekend at HackTX.


**What's in your way?**  
We will have to rewrite most of our front end for phase 2 as we get our API set up to have a better way for our data to be displayed without too much repeated code.

**What will you do next week?**  
Next week we will get started on phase 2 early. I will also have to finish the alpha phase of our iOS project which is due Thursday. I also should find out exactly what I did wrong on the first test so I won't make similar mistakes on the last test.

# The Class
We started learning about relational algebra in class this past week. Taking data management helped a lot in this topic, since we learned it previously in that class, along with SQL. We had a pretty big rush to finish up phase 1 of the IDB project. Near the last day, we changed up the format of our data and ended up having to rewrite a lot of front end code, and as a result had to turn it in with a few problems. We will get tarted early on the next project and make sure we plan out everything in the beginning.


# Tip of the Week  
Go to hackathons! They provide you with a space to be creative and make anything you've been thinking of making. All of the free food and shirts doesn't hurt, either.
