**What did you do this past week?**  
This past week, we wrapped up phrase 3 of the project without any major issues, so we were able to finish early and go home. It was nice finishing up both phase 2 and 3 early, knowing that they both worked when we turned in our projects.
**What's in your way?**  
The week after Thanksgiving break is full of due dates and tests, so I will have to start preparing over the break when I would much rather just be playing the new Pokemon.
**What will you do next week?**  
I have a lot to work on over Thanksgiving break, mostly projects. I have to make progress on network security, finish up iOS and make that presentation, as well as our SWE Interswellar presentation and demos.

# The Class  
We've been learning a lot about databases, design patterns, and refactorings. What we've covered in class is a good intro to these topics, but I imagine it could have been difficult for people with no prior exposure to these topics to completely understand. I think that after taking both software design and database management I already had learned most of what was covered in SWE about these topics.

# Tip of the Week  
Don't stay up late every night during finals and the last week of school. You'll just end up crashing hard and do worse than if you'd had just stopped studying a bit earlier and gotten some sleep.
