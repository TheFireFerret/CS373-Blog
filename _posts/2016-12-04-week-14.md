**What did you do this past week?**  
This last week had us doing our final presentation and test #2. I feel like the test was not too bad, it was all familiar topics from what we did in class and the examples that were posted on github. I also did the extra credit for this class.

**What's in your way?**  
Finishing final network security CTF and finalizing our iOS project.

**What will you do next week?**  
Next week I will wrap up our network security and iOS projects. After that, I'm free since I don't have any other finals.

# The Class  
These last weeks were full of project presentations. It was pretty interesting seeing how other groups implemented the different features we had to do, like searching and displaying data. This class taught me a lot about Python and how to work with a large group on a single project. I'm happy that our group had people that already knew how to do different things related to web development, so things went pretty smoothly. For this class, it's also important to review the last class and do the readings. The quizzes are every day, and missing questions on each can build up to a big chunk of your grade. Don't go into this class thinking that it's only about Python. There us a significant amount of material on topics like Java, refactoring, and SQL.

# Tip of the Week  
Take a look at our project, interswellar.me.
