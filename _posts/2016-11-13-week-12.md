**What did you do this past week?**  
This past week we started discussing how we implement the search function for our project. This needed to be defined before either the front end or back end team started working so that we are sure that the data we find in the back end is in the right format for us to display on the front end.

**What's in your way?**  
Not much is in the way except for working on this project.

**What will you do next week?**  
Next week we will finish the search functionality for our project. The last network security project also comes out on Wednesday, so I will need to get started early on that since it goes over the break.

# The Class  
This past week we have been working our way through java and design patterns by refactoring some classes about movie rentals and customers. There was a lot of code to go through in class so it wasn't always clear how the small chunk of code we were refactoring fit into the entire project. Taking software design before this class help a lot during these lectures since I had seen lots of different refactorings, and when to use them, in that class. 

# Tip of the Week  
Make sure to design your whole project, at least a general overview of how things will work, before you actually start implementing things. This way, you won't run into a problem with two parts of the project trying to talk to each other in different ways.
